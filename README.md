##Katalon_CURA_Healthcare_project
The automation testing project "CURA Healthcare Service" involves several steps to ensure its successful implementation using the Katalon Studio tool:

Develop a test plan outlining the project's objectives and testing approach.
Document test cases and scenarios in an Excel sheet.
Prepare test data for the identified scenarios in another Excel sheet.
Create a project in Katalon Studio and name it accordingly.
Within the Testcase folder of the project, create individual test cases.
Organize test cases into test suites and test suite collections within Katalon Studio.
Implement a test listener specifically for the "MakeAppointment" scenario in Katalon Studio.
Integrate test execution results with GitHub and Jenkins for centralized monitoring.
Continuously update GitHub with any new developments and include a report generated from Katalon Studio.
Upon reaching 90% project completion, generate a comprehensive report and send it via email to the designated host and username along with the port information.
